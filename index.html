        <p> am Aldo a student in South East Asia. I feel so sorry knowing that Mr. Steve Jobs has passed away. For me Steve Jobs is a real genius. This world has been so advanced nowadays, it is one of what he had made. As I know most movies used his creation to do the editing, also on image industries and music industries. He had changed the trends in the world with iPhone, iPad, Macbook and so on..</p>

        <p>Steve has set the standard on what quality and taste means. Everyone in this world will want their children to have that kind of taste. This is actually a beginning (although sad) for the US. This is going to inspire the US to get back their edge His impact is going to be bigger now than ever. </p>
